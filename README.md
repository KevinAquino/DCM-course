# DCM-course
This here is a set of notes for the DCM course running at the Brain and Mental health Lab at Monash University, Victoria Australia.


This will be a ~6 part series where we will go through all the basics of modelling (specifically picking out parts that we need) then to describe:

- deterministic DCM
- stochastic DCM
- spectral DCM

To go through stochastic DCM we need a SDE solver, I suggest using: https://github.com/horchler/SDETools.git download this before you start IV

Following this material we will describe applications, apply it to some real world data and talk about real world experiences.
